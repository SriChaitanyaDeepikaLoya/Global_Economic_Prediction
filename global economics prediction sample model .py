# Predicting global economics is a complex task that requires a comprehensive analysis of various economic indicators and factors. It's important to note that accurate predictions of global economics are challenging and are often influenced by numerous unpredictable events and factors. However, I can provide you with a simplified example of building an Azure Machine Learning (AML) project using IMF data to predict the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a specific country. This example assumes a linear regression model, but in practice, more sophisticated models should be used for accurate predictions.
# 
# Step 1: Set Up Azure Machine Learning Workspace
# Follow the steps in the previous responses to set up an Azure Machine Learning workspace.
# 
# Step 2: Prepare Data and Feature Engineering
# You'll need to obtain IMF data or economic indicators for the specific country you want to predict the GDP. For simplicity, let's assume you have a CSV file with relevant economic indicators and GDP data.
# 
# Step 3: Define and Train the Prediction Model
# Create a Python script named train.py that defines and trains the model:

# In[ ]:


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from azureml.core.run import Run
import joblib

# Get the experiment run context
run = Run.get_context()

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/data.csv')

# Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop(columns=['GDP'])  # Assuming 'GDP' is the target variable
y = data['GDP']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print("R-squared:", score)

# Log the evaluation metric to Azure ML
run.log("R-squared", score)

# Save the model to the outputs folder
os.makedirs('outputs', exist_ok=True)
joblib.dump(value=model, filename='outputs/model.pkl')


# Step 4: Create the Conda Environment and Dependencies
# Create a conda_dependencies.yml file to define the Python environment and required dependencies for the training script:

# In[ ]:


name: global-economy-forecast
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy


# Step 5: Submit the Experiment for Training
# In your main Python script, submit the training experiment:

# In[ ]:


from azureml.core import Experiment, ScriptRunConfig, Environment

# Define the experiment
experiment_name = 'global-economy-prediction'
experiment = Experiment(workspace=ws, name=experiment_name)

# Create a Python environment
env = Environment.from_conda_specification(name='global-economy-forecast', file_path='path/to/your/conda_dependencies.yml')

# Configure the training script run
script_config = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory='path/to/your/source_code',
                               script='train.py',
                               environment=env)

# Submit the experiment
run = experiment.submit(config=script_config)
run.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)


# Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that can be used as input for machine learning models. It plays a crucial role in building accurate and robust predictive models. Effective feature engineering can improve model performance and generalization, making it an essential step in the machine learning pipeline.
# 
# Here are some common techniques used in feature engineering:
# 
# Handling Missing Values:
# Missing data can significantly affect model performance. Various strategies can be employed to handle missing values, such as imputation (replacing missing values with a statistical measure like the mean or median), or using advanced techniques like K-nearest neighbors imputation or interpolation.
# 
# Encoding Categorical Variables:
# Machine learning models typically work with numerical data, so categorical variables need to be encoded. Common encoding methods include one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding, depending on the nature of the data and the specific machine learning algorithm used.
# 
# Normalization and Scaling:
# Features with different scales can negatively impact the performance of some machine learning algorithms. Normalization (scaling features to a similar range, often [0, 1]) and standardization (scaling features to have zero mean and unit variance) are used to overcome this issue.
# 
# Handling Outliers:
# Outliers can have a significant impact on model training, especially for algorithms sensitive to them. Outliers can be removed, transformed, or imputed depending on the specific scenario.
# 
# Creating New Features:
# Feature engineering involves creating new features that may be more informative for the model. This can include combining existing features, using domain knowledge to derive new variables, or transforming features (e.g., taking logarithms or square roots).
# 
# Handling Date and Time Data:
# If your data contains timestamps or date-related features, you can extract useful information like day of the week, month, or year to capture seasonality or temporal patterns.
# 
# Interaction Features:
# Creating interaction features allows the model to capture relationships between different features. For example, if you have two features A and B, you can create a new feature AB by multiplying them.
# 
# Dimensionality Reduction:
# In some cases, high-dimensional data can lead to overfitting or computational challenges. Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can help manage this issue.
# 
# Time-Series Specific Feature Engineering:
# For time-series data, you may need to create lag features, rolling statistics, or other time-related features to capture temporal patterns and autocorrelation.
